# CrateDB Adapter ( can be easily used with prometheus remote write/read )

CrateDB is a distributed SQL database built on top of a NoSQL foundation. 
This is an adapter that accepts read/write requests, and sends them on to CrateDB. 

 - listen on endpoints `http://<service-name>:9268/write` and `http://<service-name>:9268/read`
 - Requires CrateDB 3.1.0 or greater.
 
This chart deploys a CrateDB Adapter as a Deployment. By default it creates a
Service that expose the endpoints.

### TL;DR

```bash
$ helm install hmdmph/cratedb-adapter \
       --name cratedb-adapter \
       --set createdb.passwd="*****"
```

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes 1.8+ with Beta APIs enabled
- If deploying in production environment, you need to have persistent volumes
- Deployed [crateDB](https://github.com/hmdmph/helm-charts/tree/master/cratedb) in Kubernetes 3.1.0 or higher

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `my-release`:

```bash
$ helm repo add hmdmph https://hmdmph.github.io/helm-charts
$ helm install --name cratedb-adapter hmdmph/cratedb-adapter
```

This Helm chart deploys crateDB adapter on the Kubernetes cluster in a default
configuration. The [configuration](#configuration) section lists
the parameters that can be configured during installation.

> **Tip**: List all releases using `helm list`

> **Tip** List installed crateDB Adapter release `helm list | grep cratedb-adapter`

> **Tip** get history of chart version/ status/ etc... CrateDB Adapter releases `helm history cratedb-adapter` 

## Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall/delete the `cratedb-adapter` Deployment:

```bash
$ helm delete cratedb-adapter
```

The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and
deletes the release.

## Upgrading an existing Release to a new major version

A major chart version change (like v0.1.0 -> v1.0.0) indicates that there may be
incompatible or breaking changes that require manual actions.

### 0.1.0
This is the initial version of the crateDB Adapter chart with the minimal configuration/ settings.

## How to delete the crateDB Adapter deployment
```bash
$ kubectl delete statefulsets --cascade=false cratedb-adapter
```
